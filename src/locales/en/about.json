      "title": "About the project",
      "description": "The problem that inspired the project was the lack of compliance with medication recommendations by patients. With the onset of the pandemic, our daily tasks went into remote mode. Phone consultations replaced visits to the clinics and caregivers became unable to freely access the health status of their patients. We designed a device and an app to facilitate remote monitoring of treatments and regular medication intake. As the project developed, more people joined us, bringing new knowledge and experience. Currently, the team consists of more than ten members and is constantly growing."
